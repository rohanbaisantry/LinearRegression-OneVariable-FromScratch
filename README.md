# LinearRegression-OneVariable-FromScratch
A linear regression in one variable written from scratch in python 3. 

It is linear regession in one variable. 
Uses batch gradient descent to optimize the weight and bias values.
run the python3 file, it will perform linear regression on the data i have loaded ( linear regression in one variable ) 
it will then save a .csv file with the Z X and y values.
To view a proper surface since 3dplot is not that god, transpose the values in the .csv file and upload it to your plot.ly account.
